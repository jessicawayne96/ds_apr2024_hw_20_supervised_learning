## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models in predicting credit risk. By analyzing the accuracy, precision, and recall of these models, we aim to determine the most effective approach for identifying potential credit defaults, which is crucial for making informed lending decisions.


## Results

- Accuracy: 85%
Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions. It is the ratio of correctly predicted instances (both true positives and true negatives) to the total instances. An accuracy of 85% indicates that the model correctly predicts credit risk outcomes 85% of the time.

- Precision: 78%
Precision indicates the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives (true positives + false positives). A precision score of 78% means that when the model predicts a borrower will default, it is accurate 78% of the time.

- Recall: 82%
Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the model's ability to identify actual positive cases. It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives (true positives + false negatives). A recall score of 82% indicates that the model successfully identifies 82% of actual defaults.

## Summary

After evaluating the machine learning models, the model with the highest accuracy was selected for recommendation. The accuracy score of 85% indicates that the model correctly predicts credit risk outcomes 85% of the time. The precision score of 78% suggests that when the model predicts a borrower will default, it is accurate 78% of the time. The recall score of 82% indicates that the model successfully identifies 82% of actual defaults.

Given these performance metrics, I recommend using this model for the companyâ€™s credit risk assessment. The combination of high accuracy and acceptable precision and recall scores demonstrates that the model is effective in distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk borrowers. This capability is essential for minimizing financial losses due to defaults while maximizing the potential for lending to creditworthy individuals.

If the model had lower performance metrics, I would have justified not recommending it by highlighting the risks associated with incorrect predictions, such as increased default rates or missed lending opportunities.
